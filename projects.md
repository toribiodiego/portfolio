## Projects

Below are selected projects developed as part of graduate-level courses, highlighting original ideas and hands-on experimentation. Rather than following standardized assignments, each project emerged from personal curiosity, exploration, and a desire to deepen technical knowledge. Together, these examples reflect my ability to independently formulate ideas, investigate challenging problems, and build practical solutions.
